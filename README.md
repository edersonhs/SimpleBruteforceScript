# SimpleBruteforceScript
 The script attempts to find a valid two-factor authentication (2FA) code for an API by sending requests to URLs formed by numbers from 001 to 999. It checks the API response and prints whether the attempt was valid (200), invalid (402), or resulted in an error. The loop stops once the correct code is found.
